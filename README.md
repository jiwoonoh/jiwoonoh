- Hi, I’m @jiwoonoh, a senior @ Johns Hopkins studying BME & CS.
- I’m very interested in building predictive models using multimodal data (e.g. EHR, imaging, waveform, etc.) for diagnosis and prognostics of various diseases for individual patients.
- I’m looking to collaborate on any projects regarding my interest!
